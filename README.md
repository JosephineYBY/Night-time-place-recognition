Reference: Evaluating Local Features for Day-Night Matching
Evaluate the performance of local features in presence of large illumination changes that occur between day and night. 
The data base is downloaded from AMOS data set.
Figure out how to deal with a large extent of day-night illumination changes and how to enhance matching performance 
of day and night images. Compare classic methods with deep learning methods’ performances and conclude some points 
to improve my methods.
